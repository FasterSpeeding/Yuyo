# Modals

Modals allow bots to prompt a user for more information as the initial response
for a slash command, context menu or message component interaction.

Modals take the shape of dialogue boxes which show up on top of everything for
the user who triggered the relevant interaction (as shown above).

### Making a Modal client

The Modal client keeps track of registered modals and handles executing them.

This can be created with any of the following class methods:

* [ModalClient.from_gateway_bot][yuyo.modals.ModalClient.from_gateway_bot]:
    Create a modal client from a Hikari gateway bot (i.e.
    [hikari.GatewayBot][hikari.impl.gateway_bot.GatewayBot]).
* [ModalClient.from_rest_bot][yuyo.modals.ModalClient.from_rest_bot]:
    Create a modal client from a Hikari REST bot (i.e.
    [hikari.RESTBot][hikari.impl.rest_bot.RESTBot] or [yuyo.asgi.AsgiBot][]).
* [ModalClient.from_tanjun][yuyo.modals.ModalClient.from_tanjun]:
    Create a modal client from a Tanjun [Client][tanjun.abc.Client].

    This method will make the modal client use  Tanjun's Alluka client for
    dependency injection, essentially mirroring the dependencies registered
    for Tanjun's DI while also registering
    [ModalClient][yuyo.modals.ModalClient] as a type dependency.

Client state can be managed through dependency injection. This is implemented using
[Alluka][alluka] and more information about it can be found in Alluka's
[usage guide](https://alluka.cursed.solutions/usage/). The Alluka client
used for modal execution can be found at
[ModalClient.alluka][yuyo.modals.ModalClient.alluka].

For the sake of simplicity, the following examples all assume the modal client
can be accessed through Alluka style dependency injection.

### Declaring Modals

The only field type supported for modals right now are text inputs.

A modal can have up to 5 text inputs in it and there are two different
flavours of text inputs: the default "sentence" style which only lets
users input a single line of text and the "paragraph" style which
allows multiple lines of text.

There's several different ways to declare modals using Yuyo:

##### Subclasses

When working with modal classes you'll be adding "static" fields which are
included on every instance of the modal class. There's a couple of ways to
declare these:

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:27:36"
```

Subclassing [Modal][yuyo.modals.Modal] lets you create a unique modal template.
`Modal` subclasses will never inherit fields. The modal's execution callback
must always be called `callback` when subclassing.

You can define the fields that'll appear on all instances of a modal template
by setting field descriptors as argument defaults for the modal's callback
(as shown above).

The following descriptors are supported:

* [text_input][yuyo.modals.text_input]

!!! warning
    If you declare `__init__` on a [Modal][yuyo.modals.Modal] subclass
    then you must make sure to first call `super().__init__()` in it.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:40:45"
```

You can also define the template's fields by manually calling the `add_static_{}`
class methods either directly or through one of the provided `with_static_{}`
decorator functions. Note that decorators are executed from the bottom upwards
and this will be reflected in the order of these fields.

When using this approach the field's value/default will only be passed to the
callback if you explicitly pass the relevant argument's name as `parameter=` to
the add (class) method.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:49:52"
```

[as_modal_template][yuyo.modals.as_modal_template] provides a short hand for
creating a [Modal][yuyo.modals.Modal] subclass from a callback.

##### Instances

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:56:60"
```

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:64:71"
```

[as_modal][yuyo.modals.as_modal] and [modal][yuyo.modals.modal] both provide
ways to create instances of modals from a callback.

These only support the signature field descriptors and modal dataclasses when
`parse_signature=True` is explicitly passed.

##### Options Dataclass

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:75:83"
```

Another aspect of signature parsing is [ModalOptions][yuyo.modals.ModalOptions].
This is a dataclass of modal fields which supports declaring said fields by
using the same descriptors listed earlier as class variables.

To use this dataclass with a modal you then have to use it as type-hint for
one of the modal callback's arguments.

This supports inheriting fields from other modal options dataclasses (including
mixed inheritance) but does not support slotting nor custom `__init__`s.

### Handling Modal Interactions

There's two main ways to handle modal interactions with Yuyo:

##### Stateful

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:87:101"
```

Subclassing [Modal][yuyo.modals.Modal] let you associate state with a specific
modal execution through OOP.

When doing this you'll usually be creating an instance of the modal per
interaction and associating this with a specific modal execution by using
the parent interaction's custom ID as the modal's custom ID (as shown above).

[ModalClient.register_modal][yuyo.modals.ModalClient.register_modal] defaults
`timeout` to a 2 minute one use timeout.

##### Stateless

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:105:121"
```

Alternatively, modals can be reused by using a global custom ID and registering the
modal to the client on startup with `timeout=None` and sending the same modal's
rows per-execution.

Custom IDs have some special handling which allows you to track some metadata
for specific modal executions. They are split into two parts as
`"{match}:{metadata}"`, where the "match" part is what Yuyo will use to find
the executor for a modal call and the "metadata"
([ModalContext.id_metadata][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.id_metadata]) part
represents any developer added metadata for that instance of the modal.

If should be noted that Custom IDs can never be longer than 100 characters in
total length.

### Responding to Modals

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:125:130"
```

[ModalContext.respond][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.respond] is used to
respond to an interaction with a new message, this has a similar signature
to Hikari's message respond method but will only be guaranteed to return a
[hikari.Message][hikari.messages.Message] object when `ensure_result=True` is
passed.

Alternatively, [yuyo.InteractionError][yuyo.components.InteractionError] can be
raised to end the execution of a modal with a response message.

!!! note
    You cannot create another modal prompt in response to a modal interaction.

##### Ephemeral responses

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:134:137"
```

Ephemeral responses mark the response message as private (so that only the
author can see it) and temporary. A response can be marked as ephemeral by
passing `ephemeral=True` to either
[ModalContext.create_initial_response][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.create_initial_response]
(when initially responding to the interaction) or
[ModalContext.create_followup][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.create_followup]
(for followup responses).

##### Deferrals

Interactions need an initial response within 3 seconds but, if you can't give a
response within 3 seconds, you can defer the first response using
[ModalContext.defer][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.defer].

A deferral should then be finished by editing in the initial response using either
[ModalContext.edit_initial_response][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.edit_initial_response]
or [ModalContext.respond][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.respond] and if you
want a response to be ephemeral then you'll have to pass `ephemeral=True` when
deferring.

##### Updating the source message

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:141:143"
```

When a modal is triggered by a button which is attached to a message you can also
use the initial response to edit said message. To do this you need to pass
`response_type=hikari.ResponseType.MESSAGE_UPDATE` while calling
[ModalContext.create_initial_response][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.create_initial_response].
After doing this any further calls to
[ModalContext.delete_initial_response][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.delete_initial_response]
and [ModalContext.edit_initial_response][yuyo.modals.ModalContext.edit_initial_response]
will target the source message as well.

You cannot change the ephemeral state of the source message.

You need to pass `response_type=hikari.ResponseType.DEFERRED_MESSAGE_UPDATE`
When deferring with the intent to update the source message.
