# Asgi

The [AsgiBot][yuyo.asgi.AsgiBot] is a [RESTBot][hikari.traits.RESTBotAware]
implementation which acts as an ASGI application to handle the
interaction requests received from Discord for slash commands, context menus,
message components and modals as part of an ASGI server.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/asgi.py:23:26"
```

If the above example was saved in the file "bot.py"
(within the current working directory) then the following may be run in the command
line to run this bot using [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/):

```
uvicorn bot:rest_bot
```

But since ASGI is a generic standard, you can also run this bot in other
tooling such as [Hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/),
[Daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne),
or using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)'s
[sub-applications](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/sub-applications/)
to mount this bot on a specific route within an existing FastAPI server:

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/asgi.py:30:34"
```

The extra steps this example goes through to let FastAPI startup and shutdown
the [AsgiBot][yuyo.asgi.AsgiBot] are only necessary when mounting as a FastAPI
sub-application.

#### Serverless

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/asgi.py:38:42"
```

Thanks to the flexibility of the ASGI standard, this can also be used with
serverless frameworks people have implemented ASGI adapters for. The above
example uses [agraffe](https://pypi.org/project/agraffe/) to create an entry
point for AWS Lambdas, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions.
