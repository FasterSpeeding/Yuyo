# Yuyo

A collection of utility classes and functions designed to expand Hikari.

# Instillation

You can install yuyo from PyPI using the following command.

```
python -m pip install -U hikari-yuyo
```

The following feature flags ensure feature-specific optional dependencies are also installed:

* `hikari-yuyo[asgi]` ensures the dependencies required to run the Asgi RESTBot adapter.
* `hikari-yuyo[sake]` can be used to ensure the installed Sake version is compatible with
  Yuyo's functionality which uses Sake. You should still have a Sake version pinned in your
  own requirements as this just provides an accepted range for the dependency.

# Quick Usage.

For usage see the the [documentation](https://yuyo.cursed.solutions/) and soon to come examples.

# Support

[Hikari's support guild](https://discord.gg/hikari) provides for support for Yuyo.
