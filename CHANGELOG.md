## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Higher level component execution client and a pagination specific implementation of its
  executor.

### Changed
- Totally refactored reaction pagination client to make it more abstract and abstracted away from
  pagination where the pagination is just a standard use case specific implementation of its
  executor.
- Renamed module pagnation to pagination.
- Move the reaction handling logic over to "reactions.py"
- Renamed string_patinator functions to paginate_string

### Fixed
- Iffy behaviour around "locking" the reaction executor which lead to some requests just being ignored.
