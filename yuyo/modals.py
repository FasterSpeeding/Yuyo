        !!! warning
            Calling this on a context which already has an initial response
            will result in this raising a [hikari.errors.NotFoundError][].
            This includes if the REST interaction server has already responded
            to the request and deferrals.

        Parameters
        ----------
        content
            The content to edit the last response with.

            If provided, the message contents. If
            [hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED][], then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            [str][].

            If this is a [hikari.embeds.Embed][] and no `embed` nor `embeds` kwarg
            is provided, then this will instead update the embed. This allows
            for simpler syntax when sending an embed alone.

            Likewise, if this is a [hikari.files.Resource][], then the
            content is instead treated as an attachment if no `attachment` and
            no `attachments` kwargs are provided.
        delete_after
            If provided, the seconds after which the response message should be deleted.

            Slash command responses can only be deleted within 15 minutes of the
            command being received.
        ephemeral
            Whether the deferred response should be ephemeral.

            Passing [True][] here is a shorthand for including `1 << 64` in the
            passed flags.
        content
            If provided, the message contents. If
            [hikari.undefined.UNDEFINED][], then nothing will be sent
            in the content. Any other value here will be cast to a
            `str`.

            If this is a [hikari.embeds.Embed][] and no `embed` nor `embeds` kwarg
            is provided, then this will instead update the embed. This allows
            for simpler syntax when sending an embed alone.
        attachment
            If provided, the message attachment. This can be a resource,
            or string of a path on your computer or a URL.
        attachments
            If provided, the message attachments. These can be resources, or
            strings consisting of paths on your computer or URLs.
        component
            If provided, builder object of the component to include in this message.
        components
            If provided, a sequence of the component builder objects to include
            in this message.
        embed
            If provided, the message embed.
        embeds
            If provided, the message embeds.
        flags
            If provided, the message flags this response should have.

            As of writing the only message flag which can be set here is
            [hikari.messages.MessageFlag.EPHEMERAL][].
        tts
            If provided, whether the message will be read out by a screen
            reader using Discord's TTS (text-to-speech) system.
        mentions_everyone
            If provided, whether the message should parse @everyone/@here
            mentions.
        user_mentions
            If provided, and [True][], all user mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and [False][], all user mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            [hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake][], or [hikari.users.PartialUser][]
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific users.
        role_mentions
            If provided, and [True][], all role mentions will be detected.
            If provided, and [False][], all role mentions will be ignored
            if appearing in the message body.

            Alternatively this may be a collection of
            [hikari.snowflakes.Snowflake], or [hikari.guilds.PartialRole][]
            derivatives to enforce mentioning specific roles.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If more than 100 unique objects/entities are passed for
            `role_mentions` or `user_mentions`.

            If the interaction will have expired before `delete_after` is reached.

            If both `attachment` and `attachments` are passed or both `component`
            and `components` are passed or both `embed` and `embeds` are passed.
        hikari.BadRequestError
            This may be raised in several discrete situations, such as messages
            being empty with no embeds; messages with more than
            2000 characters in them, embeds that exceed one of the many embed
            limits; invalid image URLs in embeds.
        hikari.UnauthorizedError
            If you are unauthorized to make the request (invalid/missing token).
        hikari.NotFoundError
            If the interaction is not found or if the interaction's initial
            response has already been created.
        hikari.RateLimitTooLongError
            Raised in the event that a rate limit occurs that is
            longer than `max_rate_limit` when making a request.
        hikari.InternalServerError
            If an internal error occurs on Discord while handling the request.
